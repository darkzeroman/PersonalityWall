[Copied from Resources on the main page]
Here are some of the resources I used:
CSS Button Generator to create the buttons!
Tutorial Zine as a base to create this page.
Marco Kuiper's Polaroid Example helped with some rotation errors.
W3Schools for help when my knowledge of CSS/Javascript/HTML needed a little review!
FancyBox for the modal windows.
SimpleXML Manual for making the XML aspects.
JS Beautifier for help on making the code look pretty.
